üõ† Technical Support & Contribution ‚Äì Loser App
Welcome to the official GitHub repository for Loser ‚Äì a deliberately anti-social, anti-optimization, and fully functional emotional sandbox disguised as a social platform.

üß± Stack Overview
Loser is built using:

Frontend: WeChat Mini Program (WXML + WXSS + JavaScript), using native APIs with modular components.

Backend: Node.js + Express, with MongoDB for data persistence and Redis for session control.

Image Service: Cloud Object Storage (COS), with CDN acceleration for HD image streaming in The Abyss.

Task Engine: Lightweight cron + queue system for mission generation and passive user prompts.

üì≠ Technical Support
If you encounter bugs, performance issues, or existential confusion while running the app:

Open an Issue

Use clear reproduction steps (screenshots optional but encouraged)

All feature requests must include a justification for why they add no value to traditional social dynamics

ü§ù Contributing
We welcome pull requests that:

Reduce unnecessary interaction

Break conventional UX patterns

Introduce new forms of digital discomfort (in a safe way)

To contribute:

Fork the repo

Create a feature branch (git checkout -b feat/noNotifications)

Write modular, well-documented code (even if the function is absurd)

Submit a pull request with a clear, ironic title

Remember: Loser is not here to compete. It‚Äôs here to crash politely, together.
